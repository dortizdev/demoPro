# Vet Connect
Demo project that will be used for veterans to reach out and communicate with each other about possible issues they may be having with integrating back into society when they complete their service. It is often difficult to talk to others who may not understand, but other veterans can relate since they may have gone through similar incidents. There is also hope to have mental health professionals integrated into the platform as well

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, EJS, BootStrap
Found a suitable Bootstrap template to build my fullstack app. Altered the landing page and added used Express with NodeJS for server connection along with EJS for posting of data from MongoDB. 

## Lessons Learned
Sometimes copying and pasting previous code can cause problems, I still need to work out the different problems that exist, but I believe I am off to a good start. Hope to take it further and provide more functionality.

### Work In Progress
Having difficulty applying styling from bootstrap template to ejs files.
